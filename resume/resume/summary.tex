\cvsection{Summary}


\begin{cvparagraph}

I am 5th year PhD candidate in Neurobiology at Duke University. My PhD work
	utilized proteomics to generate maps of subcellular organelles. I have
	extensive experience working at the 'bench' were I helped deploy cutting
	edge tools in molecular neuroscience.  I am a self-taught programmer and
	data scientist. My work draws together ideas and approaches spead across
	the fields of proteomics and computer science to help bridge gaps in our
	understanding of the neurobiology of disease.
