\cvsection{Summary}

\begin{cvparagraph}

	I am a diligent and driven computational and molecular biologist. In my
	PhD work, I combined cutting-edge spatial and proximity proteomics tools
	to solve problems in molecular neuroscience. I am a self-taught
	programmer and data scientist, and have pioneered novel computation
	pipelines  and molecular techniques in numerous projects aimed at
	understanding the organization of the neuronal proteome and its
	dysregulation in disease. I am interested in a career where I can
	continue to draw together ideas and approaches spread across the fields
	of proteomics and computer science to help bridge gaps in our
	understanding of the cellular biology of human health and disease.
